Work so far
===========
Until now, I have mostly worked on my own wav file handling implementation
(using [this][1]) and some code that might not be that related to *taact*. 
This has been done mostly to learn a bit more about C and its standard library.
New knowledge includes:
- How to use `getopt`
- How to read and write binary files
- Acceptable (?) use of `goto`
- General C memory allocation knowledge:
  Always be mindful of what memory is dynamically allocated and must be dealt 
  with "manually", and what is handled by the compiler. 
  For learning even more, [this paper][2] might help.
